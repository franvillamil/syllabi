% NOTE: next year nada de discussion leaders, no funciona bien.
% probablemente mejor sea hacer una presentación todos los días y un debate posterior.
% quizás focusing on case studies? hay unas 14-15 semanas, son grupos de 2-3 personas

% e.g: in all the seminars, choose a reading about one example (many already are)
% and make one group present the case and the interpretation in the reading
% - followed by debate

%%% AY 2023-24:
% - Formar grupos en la primera semana (calcular numero)
% - Hacer una presentación cada seminario + debate posterior
% - Y entregar 2 response papers individuales en días distintos al de la presentación
% - Dejar un seminario al final para recuperar?

\section{Description}

This course provides an overview over a wide range of topics in conflict research, including inter-state wars, civil wars, and causes and dynamics of political violence.
Its main goal is to provide students with the conceptual and theoretical tools to think analytically about conflicts and political violence. Some of the questions we will explore are: Why do countries fight each other? How do changes in the international system impact conflicts across the world? What explains the outbreak of civil wars? Why and how civilians are killed during wars? What are the long-term consequences of conflicts?

\section{Requirements}

We meet twice a week. In the lectures, we will review the main debates in each topic. Each lecture has one reading assigned, usually a research article, that covers part or most of what we will talk about. Reading it is not mandatory, but recommended, either before or after the lecture. In each seminar, we will discuss a reading related to the lecture. These readings, which are \textbf{mandatory}, are shorter and lighter than the ones assigned to the lectures, and are meant to reflect or expand on the topic covered each week. Each week, some students (depending in class size) will lead the discussion, which counts for the final course grade.

\section{Materials}

You can find all the reading materials in \textit{Aula Global}.

\newpage
\section{Assessment}

% Students will be evaluated based on three different assignments:

\subsection*{Participation (10\%)}

Everyone is expected to attend all sessions and be an active participant in the discussions, especially in the seminar sessions.

\subsection*{Discussion leader (15\%)}

During every seminar, some students will act as discussion leaders. This means that they need to closely read the text before the class and prepare some talking points to discuss in class, ideally relating the seminar reading with what was seen in the lecture. \textbf{Bring them printed to class or send them to me by email} before the end of the class.

There is a \textbf{limit of how many students} act as discussion leaders \textbf{each day}, so not everyone chooses the same day. You can choose the day in the following Doodle poll (first come first served): \href{https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aO7wNypa}{https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aO7wNypa}

% \item[] \href{https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aO7wNypa}{https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/aO7wNypa}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Presentation (15\%)}

In the last two seminar days, students will have to give a 10-15min group presentation, which will be followed by a short Q\&A. Grading will be based on both the presentation and participation during the Q\&A.

We can discuss in class alternatives but, in principle, two options are: a) an overview of a single conflict, reflecting on one or more topics covered in class (for example: `Violence against civilians in Syria'), or b) a topic, expanding what we covered in class (for example: `Nationalism and conflict in the 21st Century').

\subsection*{Final exam (60\%) -- January}

Two options for the final exam:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] A final take-home exam. Questions will be handed out at least 24h before deadline. Its goal is to evaluate how well students understood the main concepts and ideas.
  \item[2.] A book review of a relevant book, commenting some of the topics discussed in class \textbf{(max 2,500 words)}. Some of the pre-approved options are:
  {\small
  \item[-] P. Radden Keefe, \textit{Say Nothing: A True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland} \vspace{-10pt}
  \item[-] A. Gopal, \textit{No Good Men Among the Living: America, the Taliban, and the War Through Afghan Eyes} \vspace{-10pt}
  \item[-] W. Finnegan, \textit{A Complicated War: The Harrowing of Mozambique} \vspace{-10pt}

\subsection*{Weeks 6 \& 7: Civil wars}

Basic concepts and types of civil wars. After 1990, there is a deep increase in the outbreak of civil wars. What used to be explained as popular revolutions, now is seen as a problem of anarchy, looting, and greed. Modern grievance-based explanations highlight the role of political inequality (especially along ethnic lines) in increasing the risk of war onset. A new consensus includes both motivation and opportunity factors.
